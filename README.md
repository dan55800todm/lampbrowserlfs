# Lamp Browser

[*Русский*](https://github.com/dan55800todm/lampbrowserlfs/blob/master/README_RU.md)

Lamp Browser is an open-source project that is based on the open-source project [Huemul Browser](https://github.com/MasterKrab/huemul-browser) which in turn is based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/). It is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) and other libraries.

To install PyQt6 use below command:
```
pip install PyQt6
```
The project is **currently** under **development**, but despite this it **works**

P.S. Due to the fact that new versions of the browser are released rather slowly, it may seem that the project has been closed, but this is not so. If the project were closed, I would announce it.

# Bug reports

## If you find any bug, do not hesitate to send it by email in the "Contact" section. Here's how to properly file a bug report:

1: Write a clear and understandable description.

2: If possible, take a screenshot of the bug, or shoot a short video where the bug will be clearly visible.

3: Your operating system (since Lamp Browser is open source, this is **very** important), how the error occurred (what you were doing before the bug occurred)

4:  And finally, send your well-written report by email in the "Contact" section
